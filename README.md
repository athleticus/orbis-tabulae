# Orbis Tabulae
## Tools to facilitate the making of maps for [Orbis](https://github.com/athleticus/orbis).

This repository is the evolution of a JSFiddle which was being used to process SVG files into formats usable by [Orbis](https://github.com/athleticus/orbis).

Its goal is to provide a set of tools which simplify the processing of such SVG files.
